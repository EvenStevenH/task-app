## Overview

A simple to-do list type app, utilizing dynamically displayed content and local storage. Check it out using [this GitHub page](https://evenstevenh.github.io/task-app/)! You can add/remove tasks with a name, deadline, category, and status. Those done on time will be grayed and crossed out, while overdue tasks are checked automatically every minute (or manually through my "refresh" button) and marked. You can also use a filter to show tasks by status and see how many matches there are.

One of my challenges was trying to set up deadlines. I only wanted to compare dates in the YYYY-MM-DD format, so I had to write a function to reformat any dates retrieved using `new Date()`. I then had to read documentation to know how to use them in conditionals — future dates are considered a "greater" value. Another challenge was maintaining the appearance of tasks displayed in the list. Earlier on, the `select` element of all list items would reset to the "Not Started" status, regardless of their actual stored value. I had to reorder the declaration of my variables and functions to fix my issue, which helped make the code clearer when I proceeded to add filtering functionality. Given more time, I'd like to consider time and time zones when checking for overdue tasks, as well as a way to edit the name and deadline of preexisting tasks.
